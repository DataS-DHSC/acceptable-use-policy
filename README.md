# General principles

Github may be used to store:

* Source code;

* Store all DHSC work in this Github organisation;
* Not store any work in public repositories without obtaining prior written permission from their line manager;
* Follow guidance on [making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable); 
* Not use the Github organisation to undertake any illegal activity or any activity that could harm DHSC's reputation or compromise the security of data or IT systems. 

Repository admins will:

* Provide access to private repositories on a need-to-know basis only;
* Ensure that repository users have the correct (minimum required) read/write permissions;
* Ensure that repository users only have access to the minimum data required for them to perform their job;
* Regularly review access permissions for repository users, including when users join or leave DHSC. 


## Data storage

All users will:

* Not store any large data sets (> 5,000 records) in GitHub, unless there is a temporary, operational reason for doing so;
* Not store any data, source code or documentation containing sensitive information;
* Not store any data, source code, or documentation containing personal information;
* Not store any credentials or secrets;
* Not store any data or project materials that is classified as SECRET or TOP SECRET;
* Not store any data without permission from the project owner (and/or data owner);
* Ensure that all transfers of data are conducted safely and securely.


## Public repositories

You may only store work in a public repository if you have:

* verified that the work contains no sensitive information or secrets;
* obtained prior written permission from your line manager;
* followed guidance on [making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable).
